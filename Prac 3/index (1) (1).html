    const faqs = [
      { question: "What is React?", answer: "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces." },
      { question: "How do you create a React component?", answer: "You can create a React component either as a function or as a className." },
      { question: "What is JSX?", answer: "JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML directly within React." },
      { question: "What are props in React?", answer: "Props are inputs to a React component that are passed down from a parent component." },
      { question: "What is state in React?", answer: "State is a built-in object that stores data or information about the component." },
      { question: "How do you update the state in React?", answer: "State in React can be updated using the `setState` function in className components or the `useState` hook in function components." },
      { question: "What is the difference between props and state?", answer: "Props are immutable and are passed from parent to child components, while state is mutable and managed within the component." },
      { question: "What is a React hook?", answer: "React hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components." },
      { question: "What is the useEffect hook?", answer: "The `useEffect` hook allows you to perform side effects in function components, such as data fetching or DOM manipulation." },
      { question: "How do you handle forms in React?", answer: "Forms in React are typically controlled components, where the form data is handled by the state within the component." },
      { question: "What is the virtual DOM?", answer: "The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM that React uses to optimize updates and rendering." },
      { question: "How does React handle events?", answer: "React handles events through synthetic events, which are cross-browser wrappers around the browser's native event system." },
      { question: "What is React Router?", answer: "React Router is a library for routing in React applications, allowing you to navigate between different components or pages." },
      { question: "What is the purpose of keys in React?", answer: "Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed when rendering lists of elements." },
      { question: "How do you optimize performance in a React application?", answer: "Performance in React can be optimized by using techniques like code splitting, memoization, lazy loading, and avoiding unnecessary re-renders." }
